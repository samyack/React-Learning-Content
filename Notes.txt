in react u need to return on 1 element 
so we use div to return so instead we ise fragments to return 
- fragments "<>" 

function you export u need to use capital letters like 
Chai.js or Chai.jsx(in vite)

---------- Hooks ------
- useState
- useEffect
import { useState } from "react";

useState gets 2 things soo write in array format  
let [counter, setCounter] = useState(10)
- counter is the state 
- setCounter is the function to update the state
- useState is a hook that allows you to add state to functional components 
- useState is a function that returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function
to update the state value.
